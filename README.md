**Does Foreign Aid Corrupt?**

Foreign aid helps in alleviating poverty — but does it fuel corruption? This project dives into one of the most debated questions in development economics using panel data (1996–2022) and robust econometric methods.

**What This Project Does**

Explores the causal relationship between foreign aid and corruption in non-OECD countries.

Uses instrumental variables (IV) based on geography and culture to handle endogeneity.

Applies Fixed Effects and FE–IV models.

**Data Sources**

World Bank (WDI & Governance Indicators): corruption, GDP per capita, population, public expenditure, foreign aid inflows.

OECD DAC Aid Statistics: official development assistance (ODA).

CEPII Gravity Dataset: bilateral distance, common border, and common language (used to build instruments).

Barro & Lee (1994): historical colonial status and oil exporter dummy.

**Methods**

Descriptive statistics & transformations to handle skewed data.

Boxplots, and correlation analysis for preliminary insights.

Regression models: OLS → Fixed Effects → FE–IV (2SLS).

Diagnostic tests for heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, endogeneity, and instrument validity.

**Key Insight**

Aid often acts like economic rent. In weak institutional settings, it can fuel corruption instead of reducing it. But its impact is institution-dependent — with stronger governance, aid can still play a positive role.
